Cortal Dendrites

"A branched filament connecting nerve cells in the Cortex"

=====================================================
This repository contains assorted threads about Cortex matter, and in this case 
especially ARM Cortex_A8 and Cortex_M microprocessors.

Update august 2015: I will start to use this repository for my Cortex M code. This will be a collection of small projects and some more general library type things, like general usb code and also MCU specific code.
